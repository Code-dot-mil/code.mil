# Contributing to Our Projects, Version 1.3
**NOTE: This draft CONTRIBUTING.md is for software projects. You do not need to follow the Developer’s Certificate of Origin (DCO) process for commenting on the Code.mil repository documentation, such as CONTRIBUTING.md, INTENT.md, etc.**

Thanks for thinking about using or contributing to this software and its documentation (“Project”)!

## 1. Introduction

The project maintainer for this Project will only accept contributions using the Developer’s Certificate of Origin 1.1 located at https://developercertificate.org (“DCO”). The DCO is a legally binding statement asserting that you are the creator of your contribution, or that you otherwise have the authority to distribute the contribution, and that you are intentionally making the contribution available under the license associated with the Project ("License").

## 2. Developer Certificate of Origin Process

Before submitting contributing code to this repository for the first time, you'll need to sign a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) (see below). To agree to the DCO, you'll add your name and email address to [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file. At a high level, this tells us that you have the right to submit the work you're contributing and says that you consent to us treating the contribution in a way consistent with the license associated with this software (as described in [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)) and its documentation ("Project").

## 3. Important Points

Pseudonymous or anonymous contributions are permissible, but you must be reachable at the email provided in the Signed-off-by line.

If your contribution is significant, you are also welcome to add your name and copyright date to the source file header.

U.S. Federal law prevents the government from accepting gratuitous services unless certain conditions are met. By submitting a pull request, you acknowledge that your services are offered without expectation of payment and that you expressly waive any future pay claims against the U.S. Federal government related to your contribution.

If you are a U.S. Federal government employee and use a *.mil or *.gov email address, we interpret your Signed-off-by to mean that the contribution was created in whole or in part by you and that your contribution is not subject to copyright protections.
