#Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

##What is Code.mil?

Code.mil is an experiment in open source at the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The goal is to collaborate with the developer community across the world on unclassified code written by U.S. Federal government employees.

##Who is behind Code.mil?

The [Defense Digital Service](https://dds.mil) (DDS) launched Code.mil on February 23, 2017. DDS is part of the [United States Digital Service](https://usds.gov).

##What is the Defense Open Source Agreement? Why not just use another open source license?

Per U.S. law, code written by U.S. Federal government employees doesn’t typically have copyright protections which causes difficulties in adding open source licenses to our code. So, we’ve explored another legal pathway using contract law in the Defense Open Source Agreement—which you can find in LICENSE-agreement.md—to add an open source license to our projects.

We hope this will keep our practices more consistent with the open source and free software communities. We intend to use widely adopted licenses for our projects.

##Since software created by U.S. Federal government employees does not have copyright protections in the U.S., why not just put it in the public domain and use CC0 1.0 for international jurisdictions where you have copyright?

Good point! We definitely considered this. However, we felt that simply placing it in the public domain and attaching a CC0 1.0 dedication wouldn’t sufficiently address the legalities of an individual’s contribution.

The legal framework that makes works created by U.S. Federal government employees ineligible for copyright protections (17 U.S.C. 105) was written long before the invention of software. The purpose of section 105 is to prevent the U.S. government from using copyright to impose restrictions on the public’s access to and use of these creative works.

We believe that software created by the U.S. Federal government should be shared when possible so that it can be used and improved upon by the public. However, software is a vastly different animal than maps or publications. Software constantly evolves with each contribution potentially having a different copyright and license status. Merely placing source code in the public domain with CC0 1.0 does not address how contributions will affect the openness of the project over time.

That’s why we’re trying this new approach of using contract law to attach licenses to our projects and using the Developer Certificate of Origin. We believe that this resolves the legal status of contributions while also remaining consistent with the intent of 17 U.S.C. 105. We're not only making government software available to the public, but also openly encouraging participation in making the code better.

##Why is DoD doing this?

U.S. military members and their families make significant sacrifices to protect our country. Their lives should not be negatively impacted by outdated tools and software development practices that lag far behind private sector standards.

Modern software is open sourced software. The creative contribution of individual developers to help solve complex problems of impact is largely untapped by DoD. Through this experiment, we are trying to more actively participate in the open source and free software communities. We need your help to build better software products and services for our military members and citizens across the country.

##Can I fork the code and do whatever I want?

Yes, but we hope you will consider collaborating with us.

##Is DoD trying to do something funny here?

No!

We mean to be totally transparent in our intent and purpose with Code.mil. Since we’re trying a slightly different approach to open sourcing our work, we want to be really clear about what we’re doing and why we’re doing it so that you feel comfortable contributing to our projects.

The intent is that the license in LICENSE.md and the Developer Certificate of Origin as described in CONTRIBUTING.md will govern the project and help keep it freely available to the public. The Defense Open Source Agreement in LICENSE-agreement.md is probably something you haven’t seen in other repositories, but it is a necessary stepping stone for the DoD to use licenses that are widely adopted in the community.
