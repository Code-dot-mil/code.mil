# DRAFT Defense Open Source Agreement
## Version 1.0

Thanks for thinking about using or contributing to this software and its documentation (“Work”)! 

At the United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (“DoD” or “Us”) we’re committed to bringing industry best practices, like open sourcing software, into the government. We believe that software created by the government should be shared when possible so that it can be used and improved upon by the public. This Defense Open Source Agreement (“Agreement”) uses existing open source and contributor licenses to make it easier for the open source community to use and contribute to DoD software.

## 1. Purpose of this Agreement

This Agreement is a contract between the person or entity intending to copy, contribute to, or use this Work (“You”) and Us. This Agreement and the open source license in this Work’s repository (“License”) describe the terms and conditions used to open source this Work.

Usually when someone attaches an open source license to their work, they’re licensing their copyright in that work to others. U.S. Federal government employees generally don’t have copyright under U.S. and some international law for work they create as part of their jobs. In those places, we base our open source license in contract—rather than copyright—law.

This Agreement lets Us use an open source license even though DoD may not have copyright protections in this Work. This Agreement also explains that You need to include a Developer’s Certificate of Origin when You contribute to this Work.

When You copy, contribute to, or use this Work, You are agreeing to the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the License.

## 2. Rights DoD Grants to You

**a. No Copyright.** In places where DoD has no copyright protections in this Work, it is licensed under the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the License as a contract between DoD and You. You are granted the rights in this Agreement and License in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions. DoD grants You such rights in consideration of benefits DoD receives from making the Work available under these terms and conditions.

When there is no copyright, the License is modified as follows:
```
copyright holder = author
copyright notice = notice
copyright (yyyy) = created (yyyy)
```

**b. Copyright.** In countries where this Work has copyright protections, this Work is licensed under the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the License pursuant to copyright law.

## 3. Your Contributions: Developer’s Certificate of Origin

The DoD will only accept contributions using the Developer’s Certificate of Origin 1.1 located at https://developercertificate.org (“DCO”). You can agree to the DCO in your contribution by using a “Signed-off-by” line in Your commit message. For details on how to do this, see the CONTRIBUTING documentation in this Work’s repository.

## 4. Your Responsibilities

If You redistribute this Work, include a copy of this Agreement and License with the redistributions.

## 5. General Terms

**a. Choice of Law and Venue.** This Agreement, and any claim or matter arising from this Agreement, is governed by and construed in accordance with U.S. Federal law and venue, without giving effect to Your actual state or country of residence or its conflict of laws provisions.

**b. Entire Agreement.** It is expressly understood and agreed that this Agreement and the License embody the entire agreement between You and Us.

**c. Effective Date.**  This Agreement and License take effect on the day You copy, contribute to, or use the Work.

## 6. This Agreement is a work of the U.S. Government and is not subject to copyright protection in the United States. Foreign copyrights may apply.
