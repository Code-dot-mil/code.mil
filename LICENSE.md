This is _**just**_ a placeholder. 

This would normally be the open source license selected for the project that works with AGREEMENT.md. 

The intent is to use licenses like MIT, BSD-3, ISC, or Apache 2.0. We hope to also support GPLv3 for a project, but the weirdness of not having copyright makes that a little more difficult. 

This is still a work-in-progress. We would appreciate your input!
