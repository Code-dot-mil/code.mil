# DRAFT Defense Open Source Agreement
## Version 1.0

Thanks for thinking about using or contributing to this software and its documentation (“Work”)!

At the United States (U.S.) Department of Defense (“DoD” or “Us”) we’re committed to bringing industry best practices, such as using open source software, into the government. We believe that software created by the DoD should be shared, when possible, for use and improvement upon by the public. This Defense Open Source Agreement (“Agreement”) uses existing open source and contributor licenses to make it easier for the open source community to use and contribute to DoD software.

## 1. Purpose of this Agreement

This Agreement is a contract between the person or entity intending to copy, contribute to, or use this Work (“You”) and Us. This Agreement and the open source license in this Work’s repository (“License”) describe the terms and conditions used to open source this Work.

Usually, when someone attaches an open source license to their work, they do so in order to license their copyright in that work to others. U.S. Federal government employees generally do not have copyright under U.S. and some international law for work they create as part of their jobs. In those places, we base our open source license in contract law rather than copyright law.

This Agreement lets Us use an open source license even though DoD may not have copyright protections in this Work. This Agreement also explains that You need to include a Developer’s Certificate of Origin when You contribute to this Work.

When You copy, contribute to, or use this Work, You are agreeing to the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the License.

## 2. Rights DoD Grants to You

**a. No Copyright.** In places where DoD has no copyright protections in this Work, it is licensed under the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the License as a contract between DoD and You. You are granted the rights in this Agreement and License in consideration of your acceptance of these terms and conditions. DoD grants You such rights in consideration of benefits DoD receives from making the Work available under these terms and conditions.

When there is no copyright, the License is modified as follows:
```
"copyright holder" becomes "author"
"copyright notice" becomes "notice"
"copyright (yyyy)" becomes "created (yyyy)"
```

**b. Copyright.** In countries where this Work has copyright protections, this Work is licensed under the terms and conditions in this Agreement and the License pursuant to copyright law.

## 5. General Terms
