# Welcome to Code.mil

An experiment in open source at the Department of Defense.

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) faces unique challenges in open sourcing its code. Unlike most software projects, code written by U.S. Federal government employees typically doesn't have copyright protections under U.S. and some international laws. This can make it hard to attach an open source license to our code, and our team here at Defense Digital Service wants to find a solution. [Read about our journey so far on Medium](https://medium.com/@DefenseDigitalService/code-mil-an-open-source-initiative-at-the-pentagon-5ae4986b79bc#.i78how76u).

**If you are a DoD or Military Department employee with a project you want hosted on Code.mil, get the conversation going by [submitting your information](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSebDzfqkH8ANSuqQFqValypmceVxNfEzOxMURfQQBAt4IgFQw/viewform?usp=sf_link).**

This repository is the open source home for the public-facing web site [Code.mil](https://code.mil).

## Build with us.

The DoD is charged with protecting our citizens and national security. We have an incredibly diverse portfolio spanning from communications, logistics, education, healthcare, and even the next generation of GPS (yes, *the* GPS!) that supports billions of people across the globe.

We need your help in contributing to our projects to build better products and services for the American people. You can contribute by [finding a project](https://github.com/topics/code-mil), reviewing its contributor guidelines, and submitting an issue or Pull Request!

> If you're curious about [Defense Digital Service](https://dds.mil) (DDS), the team behind Code.mil, check us out online at [dds.mil](https://dds.mil). We are an agency under the [United States Digital Service](https://usds.gov) that works exclusively on projects for the DoD. We're always looking for good people to [join us](https://www.dds.mil/#join)!

## Make us better.

We've drafted documentation on [implementing OSS within the DoD](https://code.mil/getting-started.html) and a guideline for [accepting contributions to DoD OSS projects](https://code.mil/how-to-open-source.html#step-4-contributions) so the DoD can participate in the open source and free software communities, even where we may not have copyright. This lets us harness the depth and breadth of talent in the open source and free software communities to improve our software and make our code available for public use.

We want your help to continue making our open source strategy better. Our philosophy is continuous iteration. We encourage everybody to [open an issue](https://github.com/Code-dot-mil/code.mil/issues/new) (or a pull request!) with your suggestions on how to continue improving.
