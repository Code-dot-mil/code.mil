  "description": "Experimental work often involves digital signals for various devices in order to control the function, timing, and state of the output for these various devices. Additionally, laboratory environments typically contain various electromagnetic interference (EMI) sources, including the digital signals themselves.  AFRL's digital signal distribution hardware mitigates some of the challenges of EMI that may originate either from digital signals or corrupt digital signal transmission.",
